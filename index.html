                <h2 class="line">New Data Illuminates the Extent of Chronic Absenteeism</h2>
                <p class="afterHeader">
                    Education can only fulfill its promise as the great equalizer—a force that can
                     overcome differences in privilege and background—when we work to ensure that
                      students are in school every day and receive
                    the supports they need to learn and thrive.
				</p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, we know that many students experience tremendous
                    adversity in their lives—including poverty, health challenges,
                    community violence, and difficult family circumstances—that make
                    it difficult for them to take advantage of the opportunity to learn at school.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:3.5em;">Students who are chronically absent—meaning they miss at least
                  15 days of school in a year—are at serious risk of falling behind
                  in school. Yet, too few states report information about chronic absenteeism and,
                  for too long, this crisis in our nation’s public elementary and secondary schools has not
                   been fully understood. The release of the Department’s <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2013-14.html">2013-14 Civil Rights Data
                    Collection (CRDC)</a> marks a turning point in the effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate chronic
                     absenteeism so that all students have a better chance of reaching their full potential.
                     The data from the CRCD is drawn from nearly every public school
                      in the country and helps us understand who is chronically
                       absent, at what grade levels chronic absenteeism tends to
                        occur, and how chronic absenteeism compares
                         community-by-community and state-by-state.

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em; margin-bottom:3.5em;">Let’s take a closer look at which groups of students were more
                  likely to be chronically absent. Disparities in chronic absenteeism by key demographic
                  characteristics are evident, though unacceptable levels of chronic absenteeism exist for
                  all students.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">The disparities are striking. Consider the relative differences: compared to their white peers, American Indian and Pacific Islander students are over 50 percent more likely to lose three weeks of school or more, black students 30 percent more likely, and Hispanic students 9 percent more likely.</p>

                <div></div>


                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">One notable trend: English learners, who face significant barriers in school and society, are 1.2 times less likely to be chronically absent than their non-English learner peers. Less than 11 percent of English learners are chronically absent compared to more than 13 percent of non-English learners.</p>

                <p>The same is not true for students with disabilities who are 1.3 times more likely to be chronically absent than students without disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is intended to ensure all students with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate education yet chronic absenteeism is a barrier that gets in the way of achieving that goal.</p>

                <p>At roughly 13 percent each, male and female students are similarly likely to be chronically absent. </div>

                <p>
                    Chronic absenteeism occurs at every grade level but is more prevalent in some grades
                    than others. Chronic absenteeism rates are highest in high school, according to data
                    in the 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection. Other research suggests
                    that students in the early elementary grades <a href="http://www.attendanceworks.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/A-National-Portrait-of-Chronic-Absenteeism-in-the-Early-Grades-Oct-2007.pdf">also experience high rates of chronic absenteeism</a>, which may be masked in analyses that are only available at the school level (as is the case here).
                    Understanding when students are most at risk will help schools and advocates better target interventions to improve student outcomes.

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Overall, almost 20 percent of students in high school are chronically absent
                  compared to nearly 12 percent of students in middle school.
                  The chronic absenteeism rate was the lowest for elementary school students, at 10 percent.
                 For more information on how we defined grade levels, see the data notes <a href="#datanotes">here</a>.</p></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5;">Next, we looked at how chronic absenteeism
                  varied across grade levels for specific groups of students.</p>

                    For each subgroup of students there is a similar pattern: the likelihood of chronic absenteeism increases as students progress into high school. Notably, the stronger overall attendance observed among English learners dissipates over grade levels, such that they experience higher chronic absenteeism than their non-English learner peers when they reach high school.

                <h2 class="line">Why Chronic Absenteeism Matters: What the Research Says</h2>
                <p>Chronic absenteeism is
                  widespread—one out of every eight students missed three weeks or more of school in
                   2013-14. That translates to 93 million school days lost. Research suggests the reasons for chronic absenteeism are as varied as the challenges our
                  students and families face—including <a href="http://new.every1graduates.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FINALChronicAbsenteeismReport_May16.pdf">poor health, limited transportation, and
                  a lack of safety</a>—which can be particularly acute in disadvantaged communities and <a href="http://www.attendancecounts.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Ready-2010-2.pdf">areas of poverty.</a></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">Whatever its causes, chronic absenteeism can be devastating:</p>

Students who cannot read at grade level by the end of third grade are <a href="http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/AECF-DoubleJeopardy-2012-Full.pdf">four times more likely than proficient readers to drop out of high school.</a></p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">Through an array of resources, the Obama administration is
                    committed to helping ensure all our students, especially the most disadvantaged,
                    are in school every day, including:</p>

        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, schools with incomplete or inconsistent data values were excluded. Less than 5% of schools were excluded for the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The chronic absenteeism question was not applicable to the school
            (the school must have students enrolled in grades K–12).</li>
          <li>The school reported incomplete data for enrollment and/or
            the chronic absenteeism count for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup.</li>
          <li>The chronic absenteeism count was larger than the K–12
            enrollment for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup. Schools with partial or missing data for students with disabilities or English learners were included in all analyses except those that focused on these subgroups.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="font-size: 15px;" class="line">Grade Level Definitions</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">School grade levels were defined using the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) definition: elementary schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is PK through grade 3 and the highest is PK through grade 8, middle schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is grade 4 through grade 7 and the highest is grade 4 through grade 9, high schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is grade 7 through grade 12 and the highest is grade 12, other schools are those with any other configuration that does not fall within the previous three categories.</p>

        <h3 id="mapnotes" style="font-size: 15px;" class="line">Map Notes</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Data might be missing from the chronic absenteeism map if:</p>
		<ol>
          <li>A district did not report chronic absenteeism data or the data were inconsistent.</li>
          <li>A district that reported chronic absenteeism data did not match with the NCES district boundary file.</li>
          <li>District boundaries overlapped and we could not associate reported data with a unique district boundary.</li>
