			<p>
				The <em>Elementary and Secondary Education Act</em>, as amended by the <em>No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</em> (ESEA), provides funds to States and school districts to improve the quality of teachers and administrators in order to raise student achievement. These funds are provided through <em>ESEA</em> Title II, Part A ("Improving Teacher Quality State Grants - Subgrants to LEAs"). Under <em>ESEA</em>, States and districts can use funds for a variety teacher quality activities in any subject area. In 2015-16, Title II, Part A provided States with approximately $2.2 billion for teacher quality reforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>Survey on the Use of Funds Under Title II, Part A</em> is administered annually to a nationally-representative sample of 800 school districts. The districts are selected based on district poverty levels and district enrollment. The data collected from the surveys are used to develop national estimates on how school districts used Title II, Part A funds across the various allowable activities as defined in the <em>ESEA</em>, as amended. Data provided by the districts are also used to provide a picture of professional development activities for teachers across the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 2015-16 survey had a response rate of approximately 82 percent. The data from the responding districts were weighted for non-response in order to produce the national estimates detailed below.

			<p>
				School districts receive the majority of the TItle II, Part A funds. Survey results show that <strong>98 percent</strong> of districts received Title II, Part A funding for the 2015-16 school year, with the highest poverty districts and largest districts receiving the bulk of the funds. In 2015-16, the highest poverty districts received nearly half (47 percent) of the funds made available to districts, while the larger districts (those with 10,000 or more students enrolled), received 54 percent.

			<p>
				School districts are allowed to use Title II, Part A funds for a variety of activities, including, but not limited to:
				<ul>
					<li>Hiring teachers to reduce class size</li>
					<li>Offering professional development in core academic content areas</li>
					<li>Recruiting and retaining highly-qualified teachers</li>
					<li>Promoting growth and rewarding quality teaching through mentoring, induction, and other support services</li>
					<li>Testing teachers in academic areas</li>					
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2015-16, Districts used the majority of Title II, Part A funds for professional development activities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators (51 percent) and to pay for highly qualified teachers to reduce class size (25 percent). Most districts (66 percent) reported using at least some funds for professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, while 35 percent of districts reported using funds for class size reduction. Thirteen percent of districts used all of their funds for professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, while 15 percent used all of their funds for class size reduction.

				School districts also provided data on professional development for school year 2014-15. These data included the number of teachers participating in various types of professional development, the number of sessions of professional development offered by the district on various topics, and the number of teachers participating in those sessions. Districts reported that a total of 2.5 million teachers taught in the core academic content areas in 2014-15.
