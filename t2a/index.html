			<p>
				The <em>Elementary and Secondary Education Act</em>, as amended by the <em>No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</em> (ESEA), provides funds to States and school districts to improve the quality of teachers and administrators in order to raise student achievement. These funds are provided through <em>ESEA</em> Title II, Part A ("Improving Teacher Quality State Grants - Subgrants to LEAs"). Under <em>ESEA</em>, States and districts can use funds for a variety teacher quality activities in any subject area. In 2015-16, Title II, Part A provided States with approximately $2.2 billion for teacher quality reforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>Survey on the Use of Funds Under Title II, Part A</em> is administered annually to a nationally-representative sample of 800 school districts. The districts are selected based on district poverty levels and district enrollment. The data collected from the surveys are used to develop national estimates on how school districts used Title II, Part A funds across the various allowable activities as defined in the <em>ESEA</em>, as amended. Data provided by the districts are also used to provide a picture of professional development activities for teachers across the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 2015-16 survey had a response rate of approximately 82 percent. The data from the responding districts were weighted for non-response in order to produce the national estimates detailed below.

			<p>
				School districts receive the majority of the TItle II, Part A funds. Survey results show that <strong>98 percent</strong> of districts received Title II, Part A funding for the 2015-16 school year, with the highest poverty districts and largest districts receiving the bulk of the funds. In 2015-16, the highest poverty districts received nearly half (47 percent) of the funds made available to districts, while the larger districts (those with 10,000 or more students enrolled), received 54 percent.

			<h2 class="sectionHeader">Usage of Title II, Part A Funds</h2>
			<p>
				School districts are allowed to use Title II, Part A funds for a variety of activities, including, but not limited to:
				<ul>
					<li>Hiring teachers to reduce class size</li>
					<li>Offering professional development in core academic content areas</li>
					<li>Recruiting and retaining highly-qualified teachers</li>
					<li>Promoting growth and rewarding quality teaching through mentoring, induction, and other support services</li>
					<li>Testing teachers in academic areas</li>					
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2015-16, Districts used the majority of Title II, Part A funds for professional development activities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators (51 percent) and to pay for highly qualified teachers to reduce class size (25 percent). Most districts (66 percent) reported using at least some funds for professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, while 35 percent of districts reported using funds for class size reduction. Thirteen percent of districts used all of their funds for professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, while 15 percent used all of their funds for class size reduction.

			<h3>How do districts use the funds?</h3>
			<div id="overall_use" class="chart">
				<p>
					Overall, the <strong><font color="#2E8A95">professional development activities for teachers and paraprofessionals</font></strong> received the largest share (47 percent) of Title II, Part A funds made available to districts in 2015-16. Class size reduction received slightly more than a quarter of the funds; together, these uses accounted for more than 70 percent of the funds. Initiatives to promote growth and quality teaching, administration, and professional development for administrators were the next most highly funded activities.

			<!-- Uses by poverty -->
			
			<h3>Does usage differ by district poverty level?</h3>
			<div id="use_pov" class="chart">
				<p>
					Across all district poverty levels, a higher percentage of funds were allocated towards <strong><font color="#E56C0A">professional development activities for teachers and paraprofessionals</font></strong> than <strong><font color="#5DBF7E">class size reduction</font></strong>. As district poverty level decreases, the percentage allocated towards professional development decreases, while, overall, higher poverty districts tend to allocate less towards class size reduction.

			<h3>Does usage differ by district size?</h3>
			<div id="use_size" class="chart">
				<p>
					In general, as district size increased, the percentage used for <strong><font color="#E56C0A">professional development activities for teachers and paraprofessionals</font></strong> decreased. In addition, the gap with the percentage allocated towards <strong><font color="#5DBF7E">class size reduction</font></strong> decreased as district size increased; in districts with fewer than 1,000 students, the gap was nearly 37 percentage points compared to about two percentage points in districts with more than 10,000 students.

			<p>
				In 2015-16, <strong>28 percent</strong> of districts reported allocating Title II, Part A funds for allowable activities designed to prepare educators to implement new college- and career-ready standards. Districts allocated over $230 million for these activities, examples of which include grade-level and content area professional development sessions on implementation of the standards, hiring instructional coaches and consultants to provide professional development on the new standards, and aligning curricula with the standards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, <strong>13 percent</strong> of districts reported allocating Title II, Part A funds for allowable activities designed to develop or implement educator evaluation systems. Districts allocated more than $48 million for these activities, examples of which include training on evaluation frameworks, rubrics, and tools; training on the use of student learning objectives; and training on the use of peer observations and feedback.

			<p>
				School districts also provided data on professional development for school year 2014-15. These data included the number of teachers participating in various types of professional development, the number of sessions of professional development offered by the district on various topics, and the number of teachers participating in those sessions. Districts reported that a total of 2.5 million teachers taught in the core academic content areas in 2014-15. Of those teachers, 2.42 million, or <strong>97 percent</strong>, participated in professional development in 2014-15.
