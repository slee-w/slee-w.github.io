			<p>
				The <em>Elementary and Secondary Education Act</em>, as amended, provides funds to States and school districts to improve the quality of teachers and administrators in order to raise student achievement. These funds are provided through <em>ESEA</em> Title II, Part A ("Improving Teacher Quality State Grants - Subgrants to LEAs"). Under <em>ESEA</em>, States and districts can use funds for a variety teacher quality activities in any subject area. In 2013-14, Title II, Part A provided States with approximately $2.2 billion for teacher quality reforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>Survey on the Use of Funds Under Title II, Part A</em> is administered annually to a nationally-representative sample of 800 school districts. The districts are selected based on district poverty levels and district enrollment. The data collected from the surveys are used to develop national estimates on how school districts used Title II, Part A funds across the various allowable activities as defined in the <em>ESEA</em>, as amended. Data provided by the districts are also used to provide a picture of professional development activities for teachers across the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 2013-14 survey had a response rate of approximately 81 percent. The data from the responding districts were weighted for non-response in order to produce the national estimates detailed below.
